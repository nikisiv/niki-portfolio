    <h1>Explorations</h1>
     <img src="images/corner-exploration01.jpg" alt="explorations" />
     <p>After various explorations, I decided to focus on corner chair. I was
       particularly captivated by the structure of a tetrahedron and wanted to
       adopt that geometry or try something with triangles.</p>

  <h1>Initial Prototype</h1>
   <img src="images/corner-prototype01.jpg" alt="idea01" />
   <p>A chair with two intersecting triangles, low-lying chair which had a
     clear seat portion and a backrest portion. However, one problem was that
     the arm rest portion seemed like it could hit the person because it was
     right in front of/ at the same plane as that of the person’s face.
     Also, the topmost vertex of the triangle seemed too constricting.
     I thought that might make the person feel trapped almost/ make the person
     fear that they might hit against the top any moment. Also, the seat space
     was wider than necessary so that felt a little awkward.</p>

 <h1>Refined prototype: Rhino model</h1>
 <img src="images/corner-rhino.jpg" alt="sketches" />
 <p>Instead of having the tilts in the backrest and the seat portion,
   I straightened it out. And gave the chair an overall geometry of a
   simple cube. It is still low-lying and can fit the corner.</p>
